The study of atmospheric chemistry as a scientiﬁc discipline goes back to the eighteenth century, when the principal issue was identifying the major chemical components of the atmosphere, nitrogen, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, and the noble gases.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries attention turned to the so-called trace gases, species present at less than 1 part per million parts of air by volume (1 μmol per mole). We now know that the atmosphere contains a myriad of trace species, some at levels as low as 1 part per trillion parts of air.

The role of trace species is disproportionate to their atmospheric abundance; they are responsible for phenomena ranging from urban photochemical smog, to acid deposition, to stratospheric ozone depletion, to potential climate change. Moreover, the composition of the atmosphere is changing; analysis of air trapped in ice cores reveals a record of striking increases in the long-lived so-called greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (#co2), methane (#ch4), and nitrous oxide (#n2o).

Within the last century, concentrations of tropospheric ozone (#o3), sulfate SO~4~^-2^, and carbonaceous aerosols in the Northern Hemisphere have increased significantly. There is evidence that all these changes are altering the basic chemistry of the atmosphere.

Atmospheric chemistry occurs within a fabric of profoundly complicated atmospheric dynamics. The results of this coupling of dynamics and chemistry are often unexpected. Witness the unique combination of dynamical forces that lead to a wintertime polar vortex over Antarctica, with the concomitant formation of polar stratospheric clouds that serve as sites for heterogeneous chemical reactions involving chlorine compounds resulting from anthropogenic chloroﬂuorocarbons—all leading to the near total depletion of stratospheric ozone over the South Pole each spring; witness the nonlinear, and counterintuitive, dependence of the amount of ozone generated by reactions involving hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen (NO~x~) at the urban and regional scales—although both hydrocarbons and NO~x~ are ozone precursors, situations exist where continuous emission of more and more NO~x~ actually leads to less ozone.

The chemical constituents of the atmosphere do not go through their lifecycles independently; the cycles of the various species are linked together in a complex way. Thus a perturbation of one component can lead to significant, and nonlinear, changes to other components and to feedbacks that can amplify or damp the original perturbation.

In many respects, at once both the most important and the most paradoxical trace gas in the atmosphere is ozone (O~3~). High in the stratosphere, ozone screens living organisms from biologically harmful solar ultraviolet radiation; ozone at the surface, in the troposphere, can produce adverse effects on human health and plants when present at levels elevated above natural. At the urban and regional scales, significant policy issues concern how to decrease ozone levels by controlling the ozone precursors—volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen. At the global scale, understanding both the natural ozone chemistry of the troposphere and the causes of continually increasing background tropospheric ozone levels is a major goal.

Aerosols are particles suspended in the atmosphere. They arise directly from emissions of particles and from the conversion of volatile organic compounds to particles in the atmosphere. At elevated levels they inhibit visibility and are a human health hazard. There is a growing body of epidemiological data suggesting that increasing levels of aerosols may cause a significant increase in human mortality.

For many years it was assumed that atmospheric aerosols did not interact in any appreciable way with the cycles of trace gases. We now know that particles in the air affect climate and interact chemically in heretofore unrecognized ways with atmospheric gases. Volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere, for example, participate in the catalytic destruction of ozone by chlorine compounds, not directly, but through the intermediary of NO~x~ chemistry. Aerosols reflect solar radiation back to space and, in so doing, cool the planet Earth. Aerosols are also the nuclei around which clouds droplets form—no aerosols, no clouds. Clouds are one of the most important elements or our climate system, so the effect of increasing global aerosol levels on Earth’s cloudiness is a key problem in climate.

Historically the study of urban air pollution and its effects occurred more or less separately from that of the chemistry of Earth’s atmosphere as a whole. Similarly, in its early stages, climate research focused exclusively on CO~2~, without reference to effects on the underlying chemistry of the atmosphere and their feedbacks on climate itself.

It is now recognized, in quantitative scientific terms, that Earth’s atmosphere is a continuum of spatial scales in which the urban atmosphere, the remote troposphere, the marine boundary layer, and the stratosphere are merely points from the smallest turbulent eddies and the fastest timescales of free-radical chemistry to global circulations and the decadal timescales of the longest-lived trace gases.

## The atmosphere
### History and evolution of earth’s atmosphere

It is generally believed that the solar system condensed out of an interstellar cloud of gas and dust, referred to as the primordial solar nebula, about 4.6 billion years ago. The atmospheres of Earth and the other terrestrial planets, Venus and Mars, are thought to have formed as a result of the release of trapped volatile compounds from the planet itself. The early atmosphere of Earth is believed to have been a mixture of carbon dioxide (CO~2~), nitrogen (N~2~), and water vapor (H~2~O), with trace amounts of hydrogen (H~2~), a mixture similar to that emitted by present-day volcanoes.

The composition of the present atmosphere bears little resemblance to the composition of the early atmosphere. Most of the water vapor that outgassed from Earth’s interior condensed out of the atmosphere to form the oceans. The predominance of the CO~2~ that outgassed formed sedimentary carbonate rocks after dissolution in the ocean. It is estimated that for each molecule of CO~2~ presently in the atmosphere, there are about 105 CO2 molecules incorporated as carbonates in sedimentary rocks.

Since N2 is chemically inert, non-water-soluble, and noncondensable, most of the outgassed N2 accumulated in the atmosphere over geologic time to become the atmosphere’s most abundant constituent.

The early atmosphere of Earth was a mildly reducing chemical mixture, whereas the present atmosphere is strongly oxidizing. Geochemical evidence points to the fact that atmospheric oxygen underwent a dramatic increase in concentration about 2300 million years ago (Kasting 2001). While the timing of the initial O2 rise is now well established, what triggered the increase is still in question. There is agreement that O2 was initially produced by cyanobacteria, the only prokaryotic organisms (bacteria and archea) capable of oxygenic photosynthesis. These bacteria emerged 2700 million years ago. The gap of 400 million years between the emergence of cyanobacteria and the rise of atmospheric O2 is still an issue of debate.

The atmosphere from 3000 to 2300 million years ago was rich in reduced gases such as H2 and CH4. Hydrogen can escape to space from such an atmosphere. Since the majority of Earth’s hydrogen was in the form of water, H2 escape would lead to a net accumulation of O2. One possibility is that the O2 left behind by the escaping H2 was largely consumed by oxidation of continental crust. This oxidation might have sequestered enough O2 to suppress atmospheric levels before 2300 million years ago, the point at which the flux of reduced gases fell below the net photosynthetic production rate of oxygen. The present level of O2 is maintained by a balance between production from photosynthesis and removal through respiration and decay of organic carbon (Walker 1977).

Earth’s atmosphere is composed primarily of the gases N2 (78%), O2 (21%), and Ar (1%), whose abundances are controlled over geologic timescales by the biosphere, uptake and release from crustal material, and degassing of the interior. Water vapor is the next most abundant constituent; it is found mainly in the lower atmosphere and its concentration is highly variable, reaching concentrations as high as 3%. Evaporation and precipitation control its abundance. The remaining gaseous constituents, the trace gases, represent less than 1% of the atmosphere. These trace gases play a crucial role in Earth’s radiative balance and in the chemical properties of the atmosphere.

Aristotle was the first to propose in his book Meteorologica in 347 BC that the atmosphere was actually a mixture of gases and that water vapor should be present to balance the water precipitation to Earth’s surface. The study of atmospheric chemistry can be traced back to the eighteenth century when chemists such as Joseph Priestley, Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, and Henry Cavendish attempted to determine the chemical components of the atmosphere. Largely through their efforts, as well as those of a number of nineteenth-century chemists and physicists, the identity and major components of the atmosphere, N2, O2, water vapor, CO2, and the rare gases, were established.

In the late nineteenth–early twentieth century focus shifted from the major atmospheric constituents to trace constituents, that is, those having mole fractions below 10^6, 1 part per million (ppm) by volume. We now know that the atmosphere contains a myriad of trace species. Spectacular innovations in instrumentation over the last several decades have enabled identification of atmospheric trace species down to levels of about 10^12 mole fraction, 1 part per trillion (ppt) by volume.

The extraordinary pace of the recent increases in atmospheric trace gases can be seen when current levels are compared with those of the distant past. Such comparisons can be made for CO2 and CH4, whose histories can be reconstructed from their concentrations in bubbles of air trapped in ice in such perpetually cold places as Antarctica and Greenland. With gases that are long-lived in the atmosphere and therefore distributed rather uniformly over the globe, such as CO2 and CH4, polar ice core samples reveal global average concentrations of previous eras. Analyses of bubbles in ice cores show that CO2 and CH4 concentrations remained essentially unchanged from the end of the last ice age some 10,000 years ago until roughly 300 years ago, at mole fractions close to 260 and 0.7 ppm by volume, respectively.

Activities of humans account for most of the rapid changes in the trace gases over the past 200 years–combustion of fossil fuels (coal and oil) for energy and transportation, industrial and agricultural activities, biomass burning (the burning of vegetation), and deforestation.

These changes have led to the definition of a new era in Earth’s history, the Anthropocene (Crutzen and Steffen 2003). Records of atmospheric CO2, CH4, and N2O show a clear increase since the end of the eighteenth century, coinciding more or less with the invention of the steam engine in 1784. The global release of SO2, from coal and oil burning, is at least twice that of all natural emissions. More nitrogen is now fixed synthetically and applied as fertilizers in agriculture than fixed naturally in all terrestrial ecosystems. The Haber–Bosch industrial process to produce ammonia from N2, in many respects, made the human explosion possible.

The emergence of the Antarctic ozone hole in the 1980s provided unequivocal evidence of the ability of trace species to perturb the atmosphere. The essentially complete disappearance of ozone in the Antarctic stratosphere during the austral spring is now recovering, owing to a global ban on production of stratospheric ozone-depleting substances. Whereas stratospheric ozone levels eroded in response to human emissions, those at ground level have, over the past century, been increasing. Paradoxically, ozone in the stratosphere protects living organisms from harmful solar ultraviolet radiation, whereas increased ozone in the lower atmosphere has the potential to induce adverse effects on human health and plants.

Levels of airborne particles in industrialized regions of the Northern Hemisphere have increased markedly since the Industrial Revolution. Atmospheric particles (aerosols) arise both from direct emissions and from gas-to-particle conversion of vapor precursors. Aerosols can affect climate and have been implicated in human morbidity and mortality in urban areas.

Atmospheric chemistry comprises the study of the mechanisms by which molecules introduced into the atmosphere react and, in turn, how these alterations affect atmospheric composition and properties (Ravishankara 2003). The driving force for chemical changes in the atmosphere is sunlight. Sunlight directly interacts with many molecules and is also the source of most of the atmospheric free radicals.

Despite their very small abundances, usually less than one part in a billion parts of air, free radicals act to transform most species in the atmosphere. The study of atmospheric chemical processes begins with determining basic chemical steps in the laboratory, then quantifying atmospheric emissions and removal processes, and incorporating all the relevant processes in computational models of transport and transformation, and finally comparing the predictions with atmospheric observations to assess the extent to which our basic understanding agrees with the actual atmosphere. Atmospheric chemistry occurs against the fabric of the physics of air motions and of temperature and phase changes. In this book we attempt to cover all aspects of atmospheric chemistry and physics that bear on air pollution and climate change.
