Part 1 Origin of earth and of life
============================================================

***Chapter Overview***

Earth formed some 4.6 billion years (b.y.) ago by the accretion of solid particles from a cloud of gas and dust surrounding the young Sun. Earth's atmosphere and ocean started forming as the planet itself was being built as a consequence of the release of volatile materials during impacts. The atmosphere and ocean continued to grow during the so-called heavy bombardment period between 4.6 and 3.8 b.y. ago, although new evidence suggests that the bombardment may have been a pulse, rather than an ongoing process. The composition of the atmosphere is unknown because little or no rock record survives from that time, but it probably consisted mostly of N2 and C02. 

Life may have originated during the heavy bombardment period from reactions between organic chemicals created in Earth's surface environment or imported from space. This may explain why the last common ancestor of all extant life appears to have come from a hot environment.

# Formation of the Solar system

## Formation of the Solar Nebula

The Sun is thought to have formed from a collapsing cloud of interstellar dust and gas. Such interstellar clouds are observed today by both optical and radio telescopes (Figure 10-2). The one shown in Figure 10-2 is a particularly spectacular one that happens to be backlit by some bright blue stars. It is a portion of the Eagle Nebula, which is sometimes referred to as the "Pillars of Creation."

Interstellar clouds are concentrated in the spiral arms of our Milky Way galaxy, where the density of material is highest. If such a cloud is dense enough and cold enough (about 10 K), it will collapse under its own self-gravity, and the process of star formation can begin. It may seem counterintuitive that a cold cloud is required to form a hot star, but this is indeed the case. The reason is that, according to the ideal gas law,  a cold gas exerts less pressure than a warm gas of the same density. A cold interstellar cloud has less internal pressure to counteract the force of gravity and is therefore more likely to collapse. Once it does so, the cloud immediately warms up because the infall of material releases gravitational energy, which is converted into heat. The innermost part of the cloud eventually becomes hot enough for thermonuclear fusion reactions to begin, and a new star is born.

The clouds observed in interstellar space are typically many thousands of times the mass of the Sun. As they contract, however, they produce smaller fragments that can themselves contract to form one or more stars. Whether the collapse results in a single star or a multiple star system depends largely on how fast the cloud fragment is rotating: the faster it rotates, the more likely it is to form two or more stars. In the case of our own Sun, a single star formed. This is fortunate for us because a multiple star system would probably be a very difficult place to form a habitable planet like Earth. (It is difficult to identify stable orbits in such systems and probably even more difficult to form a planet in just the right place.) The cloud fragment did have a certain amount of rotation, however, and this caused some of its material to spread out into a disk. The gas and dust that made up the disk are referred to as the solar nebula. Astronomers have now been able to see similar disks around other Sun-like stars. Figure 10-3 shows the disk around the star Beta Pictoris, which was the first such disk to be discovered.

## Formation of Planets

Once the solar nebula was in place, the process of planetary formation would have begun. The nebula itself would have been heated by the emerging Sun—the proto-Sun—so its interior would have warmed. At the same time, small particles of solid material would have begun to condense from the gas. In the hot, inner parts of the nebula, these grains consisted mainly of rocky materials such as iron and silicate minerals that can condense at temperatures as high as 2000 K. That is why Earth and the other terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, and Mars) are composed principally of rock. In the cooler, outer parts of the nebula, icy materials such as water (H20), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3) would also have condensed. Thus, the giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) contain large amounts of these more volatile compounds. Volatile compounds are substances that have low boiling points.

The particles formed by condensation were gravitationally attracted to the mid-plane of the nebula, where they clumped together to form planetesimals, small protoplanets. These planetesimals collided with each other, often sticking together to form larger bodies in a process called accretion. This process is shown schematically in Figure 10-4. Over tens to hundreds of millions of years, the planetesimals grew to form the planets that we see today.

While Earth was growing by accretion, its core should have started to form. Recall that the innermost parts of Earth are its solid inner core and liquid outer core, both composed mainly of iron and nickel. Core formation was once thought to have been triggered by radioactive heating after Earth was fully formed. But it is now believed that core formation occurred as the planet itself was forming. Some of the planetesimals that collided with Earth during accretion were so large that they melted large portions of the crust and upper mantle. This allowed the iron and nickel to separate out and flow down to form the core.

## Formation of Jupiter

Two specific events that occurred during the process of planetary accretion have special significance for surface conditions on Earth. The first was the formation of the giant planet Jupiter. Jupiter has over 300 times the mass of Earth and more than three times the mass of the next largest planet, Saturn. The reason Jupiter is so large, astronomers believe, is that its core accreted early enough to capture large amounts of hydrogen and helium from the solar nebula before the nebula dissipated. Accretion would have been rapid at Jupiter's orbit because volatiles could condense in addition to metals and silicates. To capture hydrogen efficiently, Jupiter's core must have grown rapidly to a mass several times that of Earth. Observations of young stars indicate that nebular gas and dust persist for at most a few million years, after which time they are either incorporated into planets or they spiral back into the star.

Jupiter affects surface conditions on Earth by perturbing asteroids from the asteroid belt into Earth-crossing orbits and by preventing most comets from reaching the inner solar system. The first effect makes Earth a more dangerous place to live, whereas the second one tends to make it safer. As mentioned in Chapter 1, impacts of comets and asteroids are thought to have played a major role in the evolution of life. A large asteroid impact may have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, and this may in turn have paved the way for the rise of mammals. Thus, biological evolution might have taken an entirely different course had Jupiter not attained the size that it did.

## Formation of the Moon

Another celestial event that had a profound influence on Earth's subsequent evolution was the formation of the Moon. Most of us know that the Moon's gravitational pull affects ocean tides. However, few people are aware that the Moon affects climate as well. It does so by stabilizing Earth's obliquity. Recall from Chapter 4 that it is Earth's obliquity, or tilt (currently 23.5°), that gives rise to the normal progression of the seasons at middle to high latitudes. We will see in Chapter 14 that Earth's obliquity varies slightly and that these variations have influenced the glacial-interglacial cycles of the past 3 million years. Computer modeling studies have shown that, without the Moon, Earth's obliquity would vary by much larger amounts, occasionally reaching values as high as 85°. This would wreak havoc with climate because the seasonal cycles would be extremely large over much of Earth's surface. Thus, from the standpoint of planetary habitability, the formation of the Moon may be one of the most important events to occur during the formation of the solar system.

How exactly did it happen? Many theories have been advanced, including co-accretion (accreting in Earth's orbit at the same time as did Earth), fission (splitting apart of a rapidly rotating Earth), and capture (gravitational capture of a body that originated elsewhere in the solar system). Most of these theories, however, involve steps that are either physically implausible or that would produce a lunar composition different from that observed in Moon rocks. From the samples collected by the Apollo astronauts, we know that the Moon is depleted in volatile elements compared to the bulk Earth and that its oxygen isotopic composition is similar to that of Earth's mantle. Its density is substantially lower than that of Earth, indicating that the Moon is also depleted in iron. Furthermore, the Moon appears to have had a completely molten surface, or magma ocean, shortly after it formed.

One theory that is consistent with all of the available evidence is the giant impact hypothesis (Figure 10-5). According to this hypothesis, Earth received a glancing blow from a Mars-sized planetesimal during the latter stages of accretion, and the debris from the impact reassembled in orbit around Earth to form the Moon. This type of cosmic accident is statistically unlikely, but not so unlikely as to be implausible. We know that it is not a commonplace occurrence because none of the other terrestrial planets have large moons. (Mars has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos, but these are thought to be captured asteroids.) Current models of accretion suggest that giant impacts themselves should occur fairly frequently, but that most would not have the right geometry to form a large moon. Our own Moon resulted from one giant impact that did, which is fortunate for us because the Moon has made Earth's climate much more stable than it might otherwise have been.

# Formation of the atmosphere and ocean

Even after Earth had recovered from the effects of the Moon-forming impact, its surface would still have been an active and hostile environment. Continued bombardment of the surface by smaller planetesimals should have released large amounts of water and other volatile compounds directly into the atmosphere. This phenomenon is referred to as impact degassing. The process has been studied in the laboratory by firing high-speed bullets into targets of volatile-compound-rich material, such as carbonate rock. The shock from the bullet's impact causes the carbonate rock to release gaseous CO2. Similar shock-induced degassing should occur when volatile-compound-rich planetesimals from the asteroid belt region or from the outer solar system collided with Earth's surface.

The energy released by the impacts, combined with the greenhouse effect of the gases given off, may have kept Earth's surface so hot that all the water would have remained in the atmosphere as steam. Alternatively, Earth's oceans may have periodically condensed and been re-evaporated many times by impacts. Any incoming object larger than about 450 km in diameter would have had sufficient energy to evaporate today's oceans. In either case, both the atmosphere and the ocean should have begun forming as the planet itself formed. This modern conception of planetary formation contrasts with older theories in which Earth was thought to have accreted as a cold, airless body, and in which the atmosphere was thought to have formed later from gases given off by volcanoes. Volcanoes undoubtedly contributed material to the surface, but the bulk of the atmosphere and ocean were probably formed directly by impacts.

The main period of accretion is believed to have lasted for only about 100 million years. After this time, Earth's surface would have become somewhat more quiescent. Big impacts probably continued to occur sporadically; however, until about 3.8 billion years ago. The evidence for this heavy bombardment period comes from the Moon, Mars, and Mercury. All three bodies appear to have been heavily cratered during their early histories. (Venus does not provide a record of this period because, like Earth, during its history it has been resurfaced many times by volcanism.) The lunar cratering record is the best understood because some of the craters have been dated by using rocks collected near their rims.

If the Moon and the other terrestrial planets were being pelted by large objects, it is almost certain that Earth was getting hit, too. The bombardment may have made it difficult for life to have originated before about 4 to 4.2 billion years ago. We will return to this issue later in the chapter. It may also have brought additional water and other volatile compounds to Earth, particularly if the impactors were comets or volatile-compound-rich asteroids from the outer asteroid belt. So, the atmosphere and oceans may have continued to grow throughout this period.

Over the last few years, the story just told about the heavy bombardment period has come into question. Scientists have known since the days of the NASA Apollo manned lunar missions (1969-1973) that many of the Moon rocks are about 3.8-3.9 billion years old. This was initially interpreted as a pulse of impacting bodies that all arrived around that time, and it was termed the late heavy bombardment. Subsequent theorists, though, had difficulty understanding why such a pulse of impacts should have occurred at this relatively late date in Earth's evolution, when the bulk of Earth was known to have formed by 4.4 billion years ago, or earlier.

So, the revisionists suggested instead that the impact flux declined continuously throughout the entire period between 4.5 and 3.8 billion years ago. Within the last 4 years, however, a new model of solar system formation has provided support for the original "pulse" theory of the late heavy bombardment. The model is sometimes termed the Nice model because several of the coauthors work in laboratories situated near the city of Nice, in southern France. (The name of the city is pronounced "neese," not "nice.") The Nice model provides a possible explanation for why a pulse of bombardment might have occurred at about 3.9 billion years ago. (See the Box "A Closer Look: The Nice Model of Solar System Formation.") If this model is correct, then the heavy bombardment may have occurred essentially all at once, rather than spread out over hundreds of millions of years. And this, in turn, might have led to a very different evolutionary path for the early atmosphere and for life itself. We should bear this in mind as we discuss the early steps in biological evolution in the remaining parts of this chapter.

## Composition of the Early Atmosphere

What would have been the composition and surface pressure of the atmosphere during the earliest few hundred million years of Earth's history? No one knows for sure, but we can make some educated guesses. Free oxygen, O2, which makes up about 21% of today's atmosphere, should have been virtually nonexistent because life—and therefore photosynthesis, the source of free oxygen—had probably not yet arisen. Nitrogen, N2, does not participate very actively in geochemical cycles; hence, most of it should have been in the atmosphere, as it is today, at about 78% of the total. The present partial pressure of N2 is about 0.8 bar. Nitrogen would have formed from nitrogen-rich organic compounds and ammonia ice (NH3) in incoming planetesimals. The shock of their impact on Earth's surface should have converted much of this nitrogen to N2.

Estimating the CO2 concentration of the primitive atmosphere is much more difficult. On one hand, we know that Earth's total inventory of carbon is huge—the equivalent of 60-80 bars if it were all oxidized to CO2. As discussed in Chapter 8, most of this carbon is presently stored on the continents in the form of carbonate rocks such as limestone and dolomite. It was originally delivered to Earth as organic carbon in incoming asteroids and comets. Following the previous discussion, much of this carbon would have been immediately released into the atmosphere by the process of impact degassing. The chemical form of the carbon is difficult to calculate: some models predict that it would have been released as CO (carbon monoxide), while other models suggest that it would have been released as a mixture of CH4 and CO2. In either case, most of the carbon would have ended up as CO2 because it would have been oxidized by photochemical reactions involving water vapor. (See the Box "A Closer Look: Oxidation of the Atmosphere by Escape of Hydrogen.")

Exactly how much CO2 would have been present in the atmosphere during this earliest period of Earth's history is difficult to determine. Almost no rocks have been preserved from this time interval, and those that do exist tell us little or nothing about how much CO2 was present. Hence, we are forced to rely on theoretical models to try to estimate the CO2 partial pressure at that time. Unfortunately, different theoreticians get different answers depending on what they think was most important.

If, for example, the continents were originally much smaller, as some geologists believe, the process of silicate weathering on land may have been much slower than today. Because silicate weathering is the long-term loss process for CO2 (Chapter 8), this would have tended to make the atmospheric CO2 level higher. Some geologists have predicted that Earth could have had a 10-bar CO2 atmosphere for the first several hundred million years of its history, until the continents began to grow. In that case, the surface temperature could have been quite hot (80-90°C), in spite of the 30% decreased luminosity of the young Sun.

On the other hand, other geologists point out that CO2 should have reacted rapidly with the fresh seafloor and with the finely powdered ejecta produced by impacts. In that case, atmospheric CO2 levels could have been quite low, and early Earth would have been very cold. We shall return to the question of the temperature of early Earth in Chapter 12. For now, though, we simply acknowledge that we do not know whether the atmosphere was thick or thin during the earliest stages of Earth's history, and we are equally uncertain whether the climate was warm or cold.

# The origin of life

The question of how life on Earth originated has been a topic for both religious and scientific speculation. Nearly all religions have their own creation "myths." While many of these stories have considerable moral and intellectual value, most are directly contradicted by the geologic record on Earth and by the sheer immensity of geologic time. For example, a literal reading of the Bible implies that God created Earth and all forms of life over a space of 7 days only a few thousand years ago. We saw earlier in this chapter that radiometric dating places the age of Earth at over 4.5 billion years. Unless the laws governing radioactive decay change with time themselves, an unlikely possibility, the biblical creation story cannot be true in a literal sense. A Creator or Supreme Being could indeed have played a role in the creation of both the universe and life, but if so, both events must have happened a very long time ago.

The modern scientific theory of life's origin was first formulated in the 1920s by Russian scientist Alexander Oparin and independently by British scientist J.B. S. Haldane. The Oparin-Haldane hypothesis, as it came to be called, postulated that life arose from chemical reactions that were initiated in a strongly reduced early atmosphere and came to completion in the early oceans. Recall that reduced carbon is carbon that is bonded to other carbon atoms or to hydrogen. A strongly reduced atmosphere is one that is rich in hydrogen-containing gases, such as methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3). Oparin and Haldane proposed that energy sources such as sunlight and lightning caused these gases to react with each other to form organic compounds in a process termed chemical evolution. Ultimately, and in a manner that admittedly is still not understood today, these organic compounds assumed the characteristics of living systems. (See the Box "A Closer Look: What Does It Mean to Be Alive?")

## The Miller-Urey Experiment

The Oparin-Haldane theory of life's origin received a gigantic boost from a series of laboratory experiments performed in 1953 by a graduate student at the University of Chicago, Stanley Miller, working under the guidance of the famous geochemist Harold Urey. Miller and Urey filled flasks with mixtures of gases that were considered at that time to be representative of Earth's primitive atmosphere. (These gases had just recently been discovered in Jupiter's atmosphere. Because Jupiter does not lose hydrogen, its atmosphere was considered by Urey to be "unevolved." Urey reasoned, not quite correctly, that Earth's atmosphere would have been similar in composition before hydrogen had had time to escape.) The flasks contained methane and ammonia, along with water vapor and molecular hydrogen. The researchers then sparked the flasks with powerful electric discharges, simulating lightning in the prebiotic atmosphere.

After several minutes of electrification, the walls of the flasks became coated with a sticky, brownish material. When analyzed, this material was found to contain an assortment of organic compounds, including amino acids. Amino acids are compounds-containing an amino group (NH2) and a carboxyl group (COOH)-that are important building blocks for proteins (see the Box "A Closer Look: The Compounds of Life"). Proteins, composed of one or more chains of amino acids, are key molecules in organisms. Proteins may be enzymes (guiding chemical reactions), structural components, hormones (maintaining constant body conditions), or transport molecules.

The Miller-Urey experiment, as it is now called, made headlines around the world. It was indeed a revelation to discover that many of the basic compounds on which life depends can be synthesized by a straightforward process that could have occurred in nature. Many scientists working in this field thought that we might be close to understanding how life itself began.

Today, the Miller-Urey experiment is still held in high regard scientifically, but researchers are less certain that it represents a critical step in the origin of life. One reason is that just mentioned: Current theories of the early atmosphere suggest that it was not as strongly reducing as the gas mixtures in Stanley Miller's flasks. Methane and ammonia, if they were present at all, would probably have been held to relatively low concentrations because they are photolyzed by solar UV radiation. The hydrogen then escapes to space, and the carbon and nitrogen atoms left behind are converted into CO2 and N2. Furthermore, modern volcanos do not emit much methane or ammonia. Early volcanic gases might have been more highly reducing; however, even this was probably not enough to produce a Miller-Urey-type atmosphere.
